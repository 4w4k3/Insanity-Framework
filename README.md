Insanity Payload consists of encrypting your code and decrypting it in memory, thus avoiding a possible av signature, also has the ability to wait long enough to bypass a running sandbox. 

##### **NOTE: Insanity payloads may experience a 1 minute delay while connecting, this is necessary in order to bypass most avs and sandboxes. **
